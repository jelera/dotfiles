# GPG Agent Configuration
# This file is managed by dotfiles and symlinked to ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
#
# Pinentry program for password prompts
# Uses a smart wrapper script that auto-detects the best pinentry based on:
# - Current environment (GUI vs terminal)
# - Available pinentry programs
# - Desktop environment (KDE, GNOME, macOS, etc.)
# This makes it truly OS and Desktop Environment agnostic
#
# The __DOTFILES_DIR__ placeholder will be replaced during installation
pinentry-program __DOTFILES_DIR__/bin/pinentry-auto

# Cache settings (in seconds)
